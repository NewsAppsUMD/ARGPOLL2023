# ARGPOLL2023
A repository for a web scraper that will scrape poll numbers for the 2023 Argentine General Election
Update: 4/1/2023

You can see here that I got so frustrated and fed up with my last repository that I made a new one to continue on with this project. The last one unforunately got very confused with the multiple branches I was doing coding on and when it came time to commit changes, the main got confused and asked me to merge changes, something along the lines of that, and I tried, failed, no changes were committed, things were therefore stuck at a standstill, and I got fed up, and started this new repository. 

Anyways, so, as you can see here, I have my scrape.py code, thats the same. The main updates I have for you is that the YAML code is done, it took a lot of trial and error to make but its done. It is NOT the YAML code / github action you saw me do in class. That one failed, so this one here is a new one. 
Again, thanks to Chat GPT for generating the YAML code, it is a good one, however, right now because I am in the testing stage, it is not set to scrape at certain times as I am still working out the problems with the email function. As you can see in the Github Actions page, I am having trouble sending the actual email. That is a trial and error I am currently going through, but basically once that is done with, I think I will have a complete bot.

The only problem is that the email that is being sent includes the CSV and is not an Email that would take the CSV results and give it to you in words in an email. Can YAML do that? But can CSV data be made turned into an email format thats understandable? That I still need to figure out. 
If you have any tips on how to help with emails and passwords, that is very much appreciated. I already setup my email in github repository secrets so thats there. I guess because I am using a google email that github actions is having trouble?
